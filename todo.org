Some thoughts:

Obviously an issue here is user-friendliness and security with regard to preventing
segmentation faults (arguably this is the purpose of the entire package). 
I think most of this should work itself out as I use the package 
to replicate some of the numbers from the sample data.

Here is a mock up of how I would like the package to behave:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from nvel_py import NVEL
import pandas as pd

vollib = NVEL('path/to/library.so')

# Get volume equation string for some arbitrary area and species
pp_eq = vollib.getvoleq(regn = 2, dist = '01', forst = '01', spec = 122, prod = '01')


# Import pandas dataframe of field data and merch specification
# These would be created via opencompile + GUI (allegedly...)
field_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/field_data.csv')

# Ideally this file would have merch specifications for every species
# in field_data (this is something I could run a check for)
merch_spec = pd.read_csv('path/to/merc_spec.csv')

# And then somehow the volume library gets called onto the field data
# and merch specifications, and returns a new data frame (or column maybe)
# of calculated volumes, and everyone celebrates the benefits of free software
vollib.vollibc2(field_data, merch_spec...etc)


#+END_SRC
